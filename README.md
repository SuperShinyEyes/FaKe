# FaKe - Facebook data marKet
Created by Seyoung Park(seyoung.park@aalto.fi) @ 2015.June.29th.


## What is FaKe?
This is my personal project for learning Django.
The application is about a web store. My web store is called FaKe. FaKe stands for “Facebook big data marKet”. Facebook has billions of users and many people can’t survive a day without using it. That enables Facebook to collect and parse tremendously huge amount of private data about their customers every-second life. Facebook is “free” but we all know where they get the cash from: the data. They sell the data they collect to relevant advertisers. We all know that these things happen but still we don’t really know how this kind of business works and what kind of data is available and sold. It’s very sensitive but also undeniably interesting. FaKe demonstrates an open market for Facebook user data. Facebook administrators can register data products and advertisers can shop them.


## Is it real?
The application is called FaKe. Indeed it is. This is just for fun :)


## Environment
Mac OS X 10.10.4 (Actually this shouldn't matter in anycase.)
Python 2.7.9
Django 1.8.2


## Tips
When you edit views.py or some Python scripts, the local server might not be able to update it quick enough. In such case, restart the server.
